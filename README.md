## You Know, for Search...

Elasticsearch is an open-source search engine built on top of Apache Lucence, a full-text search-engine library. 

Elasticsearch is also written in Java and uses Lucene internally
for all of its indexing and searching, but it aims to make full-text search easy by hiding the complexities of Lucene behind
a simple, coherent, RESTful API.
